title: Smart Safety Hat
description:  The Smart Safety Hat is a wearable device designed to enhance pedestrian safety through a combination of visibility and audible alert systems. Created using an engineering design process, the hat addresses pedestrian vulnerabilities—especially in low-visibility environments or during high-risk interactions with vehicles and other pedestrians. The final prototype integrates an LED light activated by a light sensor, a piezo buzzer triggered by a distance sensor, and a portable battery pack, all seamlessly embedded in a cap to ensure practicality and usability.

The Smart Safety Hat was designed with compact integration and wearability in mind. All electronic components—including the battery pack, ultrasonic distance sensor, photoresistor, piezo buzzer, and LED light—were consolidated into a single modular unit. This block was strategically mounted beneath the brim of the hat, allowing the components to remain largely hidden while maintaining functionality.

description:  Chess Link is a smart physical chessboard that bridges the gap between traditional tactile play and modern online connectivity. Designed in response to the rise of remote gaming during the COVID-19 pandemic, it allows users to play chess physically while connected to friends or AI opponents via a companion Android app. The board uses 64 Hall effect sensors and RGB LEDs to track piece movements and guide gameplay with intuitive lighting. An Arduino Giga manages local hardware, while Cloudflare Workers and Durable Objects handle real-time game logic and matchmaking. With Bluetooth and WiFi connectivity, Chess Link delivers a seamless, screen-free chess experience.
